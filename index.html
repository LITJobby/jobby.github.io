			<h2> The Facts: </h2>
			<hr/>
			<li>Jobby is only supposed to be used internally, he's not meant to be associated with Indeed by the general public.
			</li>
			<li>We have a trademark for Jobby in US & EU.  This is very narrow (there are more than 20 other trademarked penguins).

			<h2> History of Jobby from Chris J Garcia (former head of UX): </h2>
			<hr/>
			<p>Hmm, I guess I created "Jobby" in the sense of I made the initial penguin logo what was used on the Antartica site. I don't know if I suggested it, or came up with the name.  The latest version of Jobby, the more rounded and friendly one that most people are familiar with, was designed by Hans.

				<p>The penguin was introduced as part of our Antartica site launch on April Fools, 2010 (can't remember). Originally I don't believe he had a name and was only later dubbed ''Jobby".
				</p>
				<p>Chris Lamprecht, employee 0, had been hounding me to create t-shirt designs with the penguin on it, but it really wasn't a high-priority for me so I kept pushing it off.
				</p>
				<p>
					I think Jobby would have largely been forgotten at this point, but during refactoring some job alert code, I inadvertently removed a function that properly escaped the search query. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We had recently launched in several new countries and started getting complaints when job seekers, like those in Brazil who's searches often contained non-ASCII characters (São Paulo, SP), had problems with their alerts.
				</p>
				
			</div>
			<div class="col-6">
				<p>It was an easy fix, but many job seekers had already created "broken" alerts. After Chris Lamprecht went through the DB and corrected all of them, cleaning up after my mistake, he made it clear that "I owed him."

				</p>
				<p>So I created the designs for the Antartica t-shirts for him, a shirt meant for the small group employees that were working at Indeed at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
					But our recruiters (Jolynn Cunningham?) liked the penguin and thought these shirts would be good to pass out during campus recruiting events. All the sudden there were boxes of Antartica t-shirts in the office, they were getting handed out to college students, and people we hired had these shirts by the time they started.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jobby has continued to be used in various ways ever since, the more recent version that everyone is probably familiar with was designed by Hans Krebs.
